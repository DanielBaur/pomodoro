#### overview ####

<br>

''pomodoro.py'' is a Python script that helps you work more efficiently.
It is based on the so called ''Pomodoro Method'':
By chunking your everyday work into smaller pieces (so called pomodori) and having small breaks in between, you can stay focussed throughout the day.
This programm is based on ''pomodoro.py'' by ''Johannes Alt''. I just adapted it to fit my personal workflow.
